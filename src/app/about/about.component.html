          I am a
          <span class="default-highlight">Full-Stack Developer</span> from

        <p class="default-p">
          My interest in software development started during my college years
          when I was introduced to programming languages like
          <span class="default-highlight">C</span> and
          <span class="default-highlight">Python</span>. Over time, I developed
          a passion for solving real-world problems through code, which led me
          to pursue a career in
          <span class="default-highlight">Full-Stack Development</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="default-p">
          Fast-forward to today, I have gained hands-on experience in building
          and maintaining applications using modern technologies like

          <span class="default-highlight">React</span>,
          <span class="default-highlight">Python</span>, and
          <span class="default-highlight">Django</span>. I have also worked with
          databases such as <span class="default-highlight">MySQL</span> and
          <span class="default-highlight">MongoDB</span>, and I am proficient in
          version control systems like
          <span class="default-highlight">Git</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="default-p">
          I am passionate about creating

          solutions. Whether it's front-end development, back-end services, or
          full-stack applications, I strive to deliver high-quality results that
          meet user needs and business goals.
